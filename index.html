    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p><strong>Smart Public Services</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how our App works, what permissions it uses, and how your information is handled.</p>

    <h3>1. Purpose of the App</h3>
    <p>Smart Public Services is an informational mobile application that provides citizens with direct access to official government services and useful tools in one place. The App itself does not collect or store any personal data. It simply acts as a portal to trusted government websites such as UIDAI, DigiLocker, State Government portals, and others.</p>

    <h3>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>- We do not collect, store, or share your personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.).</p>
    <p>- We do not require you to log in or create an account.</p>
    <p>- We do not track your location, contacts, or files.</p>

    <h3>3. Permissions Used by the App</h3>
    <p>- <strong>Internet Access</strong>: Required to open and display government websites inside the app.</p>
    <p>- <strong>Camera (Used only when required)</strong>: The camera may be needed when accessing certain government services or tools that require document scanning, QR code scanning, or ID verification. The camera is only activated when you choose to use such features.</p>
    <p>- We do not use the camera in the background or collect images without your action.</p>
    <p>- If new features require additional permissions in the future, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain why the permission is required.</li>
      <li>Update this Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li>Ask for your consent before enabling it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Data Handling on External Websites</h3>
    <p>When you visit official government websites through the App, any data you provide (Aadhaar number, PAN, etc.) is processed directly by that website. We do not see, record, or store that information.</p>

    <h3>5. Cookies & Tracking</h3>
    <p>The App itself does not use cookies or trackers. However, some government websites may use cookies. Please check their respective Privacy Policies.</p>

    <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>The App is safe for children, as we do not collect any personal data. However, children may require guidance when accessing external government services.</p>

    <h3>7. Security</h3>
    <p>We do not store or process your data. All sensitive information should only be entered on secure (https://) official websites.</p>

    <h3>8. Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We do not store user data. Uninstalling the app removes all browsing history related to it.</p>

    <h3>9. Third-Party Responsibility</h3>
    <p>We only provide links to government websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of external sites.</p>

    <h3>10. Updates</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>

    <h3>11. Legal Compliance</h3>
    <p>We comply with Indian laws and international privacy principles. By using the App, you also agree to the terms of the external government websites you access.</p>

    <h3>12. Contact Us</h3>
