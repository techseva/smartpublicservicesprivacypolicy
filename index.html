    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>


    <p><strong>Smart Public Services</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how our App works, how we handle your information, and your rights as a user.</p>

    <h3>1. Purpose of the App</h3>
    <p>Smart Public Services is an informational mobile application created to provide citizens with easy, direct access to official government services and converting files Tools websites in one place. The App itself does not collect or store any personal data. Instead, it functions as a portal, redirecting users to trusted government platforms such as UIDAI, DigiLocker, State Government websites, Income Tax portals, and other similar services.</p>

    <h3>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>- We do not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or address.</p>
    <p>- We do not require you to sign up, log in, or create an account.</p>
    <p>- We do not access your contacts, camera, location, photos, or any files on your device.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Handling on External Websites</h3>
    <p>When you click on a government service link, you are taken directly to that official website. Any data you provide on those websites (for example, Aadhaar number, PAN number, or login credentials) is handled only by that government website, according to their policies. Smart Public Services does not see, record, or store that information.</p>

    <h3>4. Permissions Used by the App</h3>
    <p>- The only permission required is Internet Access to open government websites.</p>
    <p>- No other permissions (such as camera, microphone, storage, or GPS) are required.</p>
    <p>- If in the future we add new features that need permissions, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly explain why the permission is required.</li>
      <li>Update this Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li>Ask for your consent before activating it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
    <p>- The App itself does not use cookies or trackers.</p>
    <p>- However, the government websites you visit may use cookies to improve your experience (such as remembering your login or language).</p>
    <p>- Please check the Privacy Policy of each government website you visit for more information.</p>

    <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our App is safe for children because we do not collect any information. However, children may use government websites through this App. We encourage parents or guardians to guide them while accessing external services.</p>

    <h3>7. Security</h3>
    <p>- Since the App does not store or process personal information, there is no risk of misuse of your data from within the App.</p>
    <p>- Users are encouraged to ensure that they only enter sensitive information on official government websites that start with “https://” for secure access.</p>

    <h3>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
    <p>- We do not retain or save any user data.</p>
    <p>- Uninstalling the App removes all browsing activity related to this App from your device.</p>

    <h3>9. Third-Party Responsibility</h3>
    <p>- Smart Public Services provides links but does not control or manage government websites.</p>
    <p>- We are not responsible for the content, data policies, or practices of those external websites.</p>
    <p>- Always review the official website’s Privacy Policy and Terms before submitting personal data.</p>

    <h3>10. Updates to the Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new features, changes in law, or improvements in our services. Any changes will be posted with an updated “Effective Date” at the top of this document.</p>

    <h3>11. Legal Compliance</h3>
    <p>- We follow applicable Indian laws and respect global privacy principles.</p>
    <p>- Use of the App means you agree to comply with this Privacy Policy as well as the terms of the government websites you access.</p>

    <h3>12. Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the App, you may contact us</p>
